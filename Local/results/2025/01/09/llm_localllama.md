**[Ask, and it shall be given: Turing completeness of prompting (Score: 22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01992)**
*  **Summary:**  The thread discusses a paper that proves the turing completeness of prompting, with users providing summaries of the paper for the "lazy ones". They also state that the prompting paradigm means that "you can make a single LLM do anything a computer can, as long as you give it the right prompt."  The paper also discusses that a small LLM is nearly as good as an infinitely powerful one, and that making the model "think out loud" helps it solve complex problems. Some users are also debating if intelligence is Turing computable, and if training LLMs to respond with "no" to any given prompt means they will not learn to reason.
*  **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is positive and intellectual, with users expressing interest and curiosity in the theoretical aspects of prompting, although there is a mild degree of skepticism.
*  **Top 3 Points of View:**
    * The paper proves that prompting is Turing-complete, and that a single LLM can perform any task that a computer can do with the right prompt.
    *  It is great that even a small LLM is nearly as good as an infinitely powerful one, thanks to prompts.
    * The capacity to reason in LLMs is still debated, since training a LLM to respond "no" to everything, means it will not learn to generally reason.
