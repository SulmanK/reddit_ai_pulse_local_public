*   **Emotion:** The overall emotional tone is neutral, although there is a sense of hope and cautious optimism. There are also some expressions of doubt.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  A junior-level professional has interviews scheduled, marking a positive change compared to the previous months in 2024.
    *  Hiring processes are cyclical, influenced by company fiscal years and holiday periods, and the best time to look for work is Q1 of any year.
    *   Leetcode and DataLemur are recommended as free resources for improving SQL skills.

**[data experience (Score: 457)](https://i.redd.it/aun922n06bbe1.jpeg)**
*   **Summary:** This is a thread centered around a meme image about data visualization and multi-dimensionality.
*   **Emotion:** The thread has a lighthearted tone, with a mix of humor and shared frustrations about data analysis.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  Scatter plots are a pain point.
    *  Adding size and shape of a dot as a dimension is a funny suggestion.
     *  Some users share a frustration with the complexity and absurdity of data representation methods.

**[I was penalized in a DS interview for answering that I would use a Generalized Linear Model for an A/B test with an outcome of time on an app... But a linear model with a binary predictor is equivalent to a t-test. Has anyone had occasions where the interviewer was wrong? (Score: 198)](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1hx305z/i_was_penalized_in_a_ds_interview_for_answering/)**
*   **Summary:** The thread is about whether it is acceptable to use a Generalized Linear Model instead of a t-test in an interview for an A/B test, and whether the interviewer was correct in penalizing the use of a GLM.
*   **Emotion:** The overall tone is mixed, with some users being critical of the interviewee while others are more sympathetic. Some negativity is expressed towards the interviewer's approach.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *   Using a Generalized Linear Model might overcomplicate the situation. Simpler methods like a t-test are often sufficient.
    *  The interviewer might have rejected the answer because it's not about the best method but about industry consensus. If the industry uses t-test for A/B test, providing an alternative solution creates a problem for the one who evaluates you.
    *  Interviews should be discussions rather than quizzes, so the interviewer should have provided feedback during the interview itself.

*  **Emotion:** The thread is mostly neutral with a few comments expressing negativity due to the competitive nature of the interview process.
*   **Top 3 Points of View:**
    *  It's best to apply first, then tailor your preparation to the specific job description, researching the company and prepping answers to common questions.
    *  It's better to do generic prep before applying, because there are similarities between companies and the interview process, and you should prepare for SQL interviews before you get that 1st round interview.
    *  Generic interview prep while also applying would be best. Once you land an interview, you can then tailor to this company and role.
